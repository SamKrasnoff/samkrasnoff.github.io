I'm Sam Krasnoff, a passionate software engineer based in New York City with a keen interest in cybersecurity. I graduated from Boston University in 2022 with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. Driven by an insatiable curiosity for technology, I embarked on my journey into the realm of software engineering with a thirst for innovation and problem-solving. Over the years, I've honed my skills in various programming languages and frameworks, mastering the art of developing scalable and reliable software applications. 

Additionally, my fascination with cybersecurity emerged from a deep understanding of the critical importance of safeguarding digital infrastructures in today's interconnected world. Though many topics facinate me, I have been most drawn to network and hardware security, and the protocols, standards, and structures built around them. Whether it's brushing up on my Burp Suite skills, reading about new encryption protocols, or educating others about cybersecurity best practices, I'm committed to making the digital world a safer place.

Beyond my technical expertise, I pride myself on my ability to collaborate closely with cross-functional teams, translating complex technical concepts into understandable language for users at all levels.

Outside of the digital realm, you can find me exploring new restaurants and locations across the city, bouldering, or, if the weather permits, reading in the park. I believe in the importance of maintaining a well-rounded life and finding balance between professional pursuits and personal passions.
